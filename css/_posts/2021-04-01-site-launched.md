Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. 
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) 
and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
Lots of thanks to Hank Quinlan (http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#css).
