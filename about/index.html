    <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am a third year student at University of Toronto, specializing in Applied Statistics and math. 
          My short-term goal is to be accepted by the graduate school of U of T. 
          I am a cat-lover, and I have a ragdoll, she's the most adorable cat, I love her so much. 
          My cat is named Elfie and she is turning one year old this May, 2021. </p>
