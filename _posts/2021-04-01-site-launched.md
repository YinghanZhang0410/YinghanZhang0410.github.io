Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. 
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) 
and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. <br>
Lots of thanks to Hank Quinlan (http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#css) and Khan Academy (https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css).
